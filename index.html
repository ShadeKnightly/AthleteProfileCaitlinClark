        <p>After a collegiate career for the ages where she set a slew of records including most career points, most career 3-pointers, and most points in a season, Caitlin Clark knew that her rookie year in the pros with a target square on her back would be her biggest challenge to date. Clark, known for her sharpshooting prowess, was not just a scorer, but excelled at Iowa being a leader and facilitator as well. In fact, the last three years of her college career, she led the whole conference in assists per game. That being said, the publicity and hype around her being drafted number 1 in the 2023 WNBA Draft was not always met warmly by WNBA veterans.</p>

        <p>Clark struggled her first few games with the outmatched Indiana Fever as she tried to acclimate herself to the harsher and faster pro league. She especially struggled with turnovers, posting 10 in her first pro game. The Fever lost nine of their first ten games and it looked like Clark’s rookie season would be a wash, but just in time for the WNBA Commissioner’s Cup, Clark flipped a switch for the rest of the season as the Indiana fever went 19-9 the rest of the way and snuck into a playoff spot. Although they were bounced in the first round, Clark’s rookie season was a resounding success even with her early struggles. She set the season record for assists and won the Rookie of the Year award. With a full season under her belt, Clark Fever might just be getting started in Indiana.</p>

        <p>There was also a controversy involving Clark during the WNBA season that eclipsed not just the league but made its way across the Atlantic to Paris. Even though the All-Star voting was having a 600% surge from the year before with Clark being a big reason for that, USA Basketball left the rookie off the Olympic team. At first, leaving a rookie off the team might not seem like a big deal, especially with how much hate she was getting with some of her All-Star peers, but this went beyond the egos and might have hurt developing the global presence of the oft-floundering league.  </p>
